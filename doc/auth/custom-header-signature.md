```php
use SwaggerPetstoreOpenAPI30Lib\Authentication\ApiKeyCredentialsBuilder;
use SwaggerPetstoreOpenAPI30Lib\SwaggerPetstoreOpenAPI30ClientBuilder;

$client = SwaggerPetstoreOpenAPI30ClientBuilder::init()
    ->apiKeyCredentials(
        ApiKeyCredentialsBuilder::init(
            'api_key'
        )
    )
    ->build();
